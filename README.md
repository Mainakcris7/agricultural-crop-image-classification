# Agricultural Plant Image Classifier

Welcome to the Agricultural Plant Image Classifier project. This repository contains an image classification model that can identify various agricultural plants, including wheat, rice, maize, jute, and sugarcane. The model is designed to assist in the automated recognition of these important crops, providing valuable insights for agriculture and crop management.

The image classifier is powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (`CNN`) and leverages Transfer Learning techniques, utilizing the `EfficientNetB2` architecture to achieve high accuracy in plant recognition. We aim to contribute to the field of precision agriculture and assist farmers and researchers in identifying and monitoring crop types effectively.

Feel free to explore the documentation to learn more about the project, its objectives, how to use the model, and its potential applications. Our use of CNN and Transfer Learning with EfficientNetB2 ensures robust performance and adaptability for diverse agricultural scenarios.


### Streamlit app
**To run the Streamlit app**, simply execute the following script in your terminal:
